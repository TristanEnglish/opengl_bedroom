# OpenGL Bedroom - Final Project Submission for CSCI4229

Tristan English
CSCI4229 Fall 2022

## Description

For this project, I modeled, lit, and textured a fully furnished bedroom in OpenGL 2.0.

Extra notes / things I'm especially proud of!
- The walls, door, and window disappear appropriately depending on view angle! This allows you to see the room at all angles without obstructions.
- I spent a lot of time on some more complex, non-cuboid objects! The lamps on the dresser and the luxo lamp on the desk proved to be a challenge!
- Make sure to press c to see the individual objects separately!
