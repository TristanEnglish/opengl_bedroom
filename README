Final Project Submission

Tristan English
CSCI4229 Fall 2022

For this project, I modeled, lit, and textured a fully furnished bedroom in OpenGL 2.0.

To run, just run make and ./final.

Make sure to press c to see the indivdual objects separately.

Some things I am especially proud of:
- Walls, door, and window disappear appropriately depending on view angle
- Luxo Lamp on Desk
- Penguins on Shelves

Texture images sourced from textures.com, CSCIx229 library sourced from Willem A. (Vlakkies) Schreuder.
