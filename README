Final Project Submission

Tristan English
CSCI4229 Fall 2022

For this project, I modeled and textured a fully furnished bedroom.

To run, just run make and ./final.

Make sure to press c to see the indivdual objects separately.

Some things I am especially proud of:
- Walls, door, and window disappear appropriately depending on view angle
- Luxo Lamp on Desk
- Chair
